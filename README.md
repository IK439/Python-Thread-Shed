# Python Thread Shed

This Python script processes a large, messy string containing daily sales data from Thread Shed. The dataset includes customer names, sale amounts, types of threads purchased, and transaction dates.  

The script performs the following tasks:  

- Cleans and parses the raw sales data.  
- Extracts customer names, sales amounts, and thread colours.  
- Flattens multi-colour thread purchases into individual entries.  
- Calculates the total sales for the day.  
- Counts and displays the number of threads sold for each distinct colour.  

This script demonstrates data cleaning, aggregation, and analysis techniques in Python, suitable for handling semi-structured sales data.
